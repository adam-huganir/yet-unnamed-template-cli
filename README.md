`yutc`? maybe? idk

## Usage

```sh
yutc --help
```

# Why?

I had very specific and personal requirements
that [gomplate](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate) and others weren't
quite able to meet.
So really i just made this for myself and my day-job, and in case anyone else
finds it useful, here it is.
Enjoy the weird niche features!

Others will likely be more actively maintained, and are rad so check them out!
